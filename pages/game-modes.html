    <title>League of Legends - Game Modes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    <h2>Game Modes</h2>
    <p>
      League of Legends currently supports five game modes over two maps. There
      is also a special game mode that rotates between a couple different
      options every few months. Recently Riot Games added support for Team Fight
      Tactics to the client as well.

    <h3>Summoners Rift</h3>
    <h4>Game Modes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Blind Pick</li>
      <li>Draft Pick</li>
      <li>Ranked Solo/Duo</li>
      <li>Ranked Flex</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Summoners Rift is the classic League of Legends map with 4 supported game
      modes. Blind pick allows anyone to pick any champion, whereas draft pick
      introduces the banning of 10 champions, along side no duplicate champions
      being picked. The ranked leagues are of the same game type, just with
      varying <em>team sizes</em> and who's result end in a player ranking
      increase/decrease that is tracked on a leaderboard.

    <h3>Howling Abyss</h3>
    <h4>Game Modes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>ARAM - All Random All Mid</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A fun mode where everyone receives a random champion and the game is
      played on a one lane map instead of a three lane map.

    <h3>Team Fight Tactics</h3>
    <p>
      This is a unique game mode that changes the core gameplay from a MOBA to
      an auto-battler. It uses the same champions from League of Legends albeit
      with modified abilities and stats to accommodate them within this
      different mode.
