    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I began playing League of Legends in 2011 and still play to this day. I
      have met many great friends through this game, and especially during the
      recent Covid Pandemic is has helped me retain friendships.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have also partaken in League of Legends esports for the past six years,
      maintaining a position with a top three team within our local community
      tournaments. I am currently working on coaching a newer team in order to
      help grow the local scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Esports is the reason I got into web development, since I wanted to be
      able to create applications and websites that can assist with tournaments,
      rankings, and other community based activities. I believe esports will
      play a big role in the future of entertainment, and I feel honoured to be
      at the beginning of it all.
